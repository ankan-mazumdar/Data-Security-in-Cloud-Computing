# Data-Security-in-Cloud-Computing
Cloud computing is one the most important and developing concept for both the developers and the users
Resources are shared among all of the servers, users and individuals.
In the area of cloud computing different security models and algorithms are applied
we have proposed new security architecture for cloud computing platform
In this model high ranked security algorithms are used for giving secured communication process

In Cloud computing technology , the most important issue is security and how cloud provider assures it. 
 Cloud computing focuses a new challenging security threats. Therefore, a data security model must solve the most challenges .
Default gateway platform encrypts sensitive data automatically in a real time 
Unauthorized person only sees encrypted data. Authorized person accesses successfully in his cloud, the data is decrypted in real time for use.
